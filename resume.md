#### Helm Society - Assistant to CEO/ Program Manager &emsp; <small>*2012 - 2014*</small>



> I worked alongside CEO Josh Klenoff in every stage of building this company.  I sold, managed accounts, recruited, and coded our account management processes.

•	Managed a team of three programmers who customized “micro-site invitations” made with Ruby on Rails.

•	Built company processes, including a system that ensured salesmen had a sufficient funnel of leads every day -- by delegating simple email responses and call-scheduling to an offsite team.  I also created an extensive CRM using just Google Docs (I believe it is still in use).
