## Experience


####Participant at Recurse Center &emsp; <small>*October 2016 - current*</small>
`Python` `Flask/Django` `Postgres/SQLAlchemy/SQL` `Javascript` `Full-Stack`

•	I built [winthemini](https://github.com/j10sanders/crossword) - a social network for people who do the NYT Daily-Mini Crossword puzzle, contributed to open source projects like [proselint](http://proselint.com/), pair programmed on a bunch of projects, and learned Javascript.

`SQL` `Networking` `Mobile Development` `Project Management` `Agile`

>I managed the NYC group of Tech Support specialists and all technical support for our Online Banking product. I had widespread responsibilities that included: training, troubleshooting (often on Credit Unions' servers), and managing projects.

•	Trained and oversaw on-boarding of new tech-support staff.

•	Managed the NYC tech support team and all tech support working with our Online Banking product.

•	Managed projects, such as the development of our ticket ticket-tracking software ([Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker)).  I also led our internal transition from Redmine to Jira, and our transition from gotomeeting to screenconnect.

#### Helm Society - Assistant to CEO/ Program Manager &emsp; <small>*2012 - 2014*</small>



> I worked alongside CEO Josh Klenoff in every stage of building this company.  I sold, managed accounts, recruited, and coded our account management processes.

•	Managed a team of three programmers who customized “microsite invitations” made with Ruby on Rails.

•	Built company processes, including a system that ensured salesmen had a sufficient funnel of leads every day -- by delegating simple email responses and call-scheduling to an offsite team.  I also created an extensive CRM using just Google Docs (I believe it is still in use).
