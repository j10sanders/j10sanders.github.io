I majored in Philosophy at NYU.

I worked/hustled for crazy hours at a startup (the Helm Society) during my Senior year, and for a year after graduating.

I worked at Access Softek (company that makes mobile apps for Credit Unions) where I became the manager of the NYC tech support team. I learned a lot about iOS/Android development and troubleshooting processes.

During my time at Access Softek, I spent my nights and weekends learning to program and taking CS courses; I wanted to make apps instead of fixing them.

I enrolled at RC and am enjoying spending all my time programming (primarily with Python): building web apps, contributing to Open Source projects, and pairing with people who are making interesting stuff.

## Experience

#### Access Softek - Manager of NYC and Online Banking Tech Support/ IT/ Project Manager &emsp; <small>*2014 - 2016*</small>

`SQL` `Networking` `Mobile Development` `Project Management` `Agile`

>I managed the NYC group of Tech Support specialists and all technical support for our Online Banking product. I had widespread responsibilities that included: training, troubleshooting (often on Credit Unions' servers), and managing projects.

•	Train: I was responsible for overseeing and providing the training of new tech-support staff.

•	Manage People: I set expectations and motivated my team to meet benchmarks that I helped define.

•	Manage Projects: I created and managed the ticket submission process, while leading our ticket-tracking software ([Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker)) development).  I also led our internal transition from Redmine to Jira.

•	Manage Products: I managed multiple high-priority projects to fix bugs in live apps, including making them ADA compliant.  I also managed/set sprints for Online Banking features and bug fixes.

#### Helm Society - Assistant to CEO/ Program Manager &emsp; <small>*2012 - 2014*</small>

`Ruby on Rails` `Full-On Startup Hustle`

> I worked alongside CEO Josh Klenoff in every stage of building this company.  I sold, managed accounts, recruited, and coded our account management processes.  I’m most proud of the last part.

•	Managed: I was responsible for a team of three programmers who customized “microsite invitations” made with Ruby on Rails.

•	Built process: I coded the company processes.  Among them: a system that ensured salesmen had a sufficient funnel of leads every day -- by delegating simple email responses and call-scheduling to an offsite team.  Also, I created an extensive CRM using just Google Docs (I believe it is still in use).
