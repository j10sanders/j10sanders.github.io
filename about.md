My name is Jonathan, and I'm a programmer because I like building things.  Here are a couple things I am building (or helping to build):

- A social-network for NYT Daily-Mini Crossword players:  [winthemini](https://winthemini.herokuapp.com/)
- Proselint, a linter for prose: [proselint.com](http://proselint.com/)

The list of non-progamming things that I enjoy includes: [[ultimate, ](http://discny.org/)[mandolin, ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xeLXC5Ph98)[board games, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan)[powerlifting, ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMIGc-PqsBc)[martinis](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/04/dry-martini-the-king-of-cocktails/16543/)].
