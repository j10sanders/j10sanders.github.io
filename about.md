My name is Jonathan, and I'm a programmer because I like making things.  I'm fascinated by web3 technologies and I love React, so I'm working on [dimpull.com](https://www.dimpull.com)


The list of non-progamming things that I enjoy includes: [[ultimate](http://discny.org/), [mandolin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xeLXC5Ph98), [board games](http://www.faroffgames.com/xia/), [powerlifting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMIGc-PqsBc), [martinis](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2009/04/dry-martini-the-king-of-cocktails/16543/)].

My <a href="{{ "/resume" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">resume is here</a>, and [this is my github profile](https://github.com/j10sanders).
