## Experience


#### Recurse Center - Participant (Fullstack) <small>*September 2016 - January '17*</small>
`Python`, `Flask/Django`, `Postgres/SQLAlchemy/SQL`, `Javascript`, `Full-Stack Web-Development`

I built [winthemini](https://github.com/j10sanders/crossword) - a social network for people who do the NYT Daily-Mini Crossword puzzle, contributed to open source projects like [proselint](http://proselint.com/), pair programmed on a bunch of projects, and learned Javascript. 


#### Access Softek - Manager of NYC and Online Banking TS/ IT/ Project Manager <small>*2014 - '16*</small>
`SQL`, `Networking`, `Mobile Development`, `Project Management`, `Agile`, `Python Scripting`

I managed the NYC group of Tech Support specialists and all technical support for our Online Banking product. I had widespread responsibilities that included: training, troubleshooting (often on Credit Unions' servers), and managing projects.

- Trained and oversaw on-boarding of new tech-support staff.
- Managed the NYC tech support team and all tech support working with our Online Banking product.
- Managed projects, such as the development of our ticket ticket-tracking software ([Request Tracker](https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker)).  I also led our internal transition from Redmine to Jira, and from GoToMeeting to ScreenConnect.
- Managed product development for fixing bugs in live apps and making them ADA compliant.  I also managed/set sprints for Online Banking features and bug fixes.
- Wrote Python scripts to provide monitoring coverage of production systems.


#### Helm Society - Assistant to CEO/ Program Manager <small>*2012 - '14*</small>


I worked alongside CEO Josh Klenoff in every stage of building this company.  I sold, managed accounts, recruited, and coded our account management processes.

- Managed a team of three programmers who customized “micro-site invitations” made with Ruby on Rails.
- Built company processes, including a system that ensured salesmen had a sufficient funnel of leads every day -- by delegating simple email responses and call-scheduling to an offsite team.  I also created an extensive CRM using just Google Docs (I believe it is still in use).
