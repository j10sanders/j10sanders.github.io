Do you have, or want, a Pocket Chip?  Do you have a Chromecast Audio for each of the speaker setups in your house?  If you answered "yes" to the first question and "no" to the second, then this tutorial is for you! ðŸ“» 

I also answered "yes" to the first question and "no" to the second.  And I wanted a way to stream any music I can play on my phone, to my home speakers.  I have a Marshall Stanmore speaker that has Bluetooth built in, but Bluetooth sucks: pairing can be a pain, especially if you want to switch the device controlling music (you have guests over).  And Bluetooth reception is poor - I can't bring my phone with me to my bedroom and expect uninterrupted audio in my living room.  This is a major downer when I have people over -- my phone has to stay in the living room, so I end up just plugging it in Auxiliary Input.  But since I setup Mopidy + GMusic + web extensions on my Pocket CHIP, those days are over.

If you would like to do this yourself, and you are a Spotify subscriber, I recommend checking out this post by one of the CHIP developers, pnyboer, which shows you how to configure Mopidy for Spotify use: [https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/calling-any-spotify-users/6430/6](https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/calling-any-spotify-users/6430/6).  I would add a caveat to his post: Don't bother changing the `[mpd]` section of your mopidy config file.  If you don't know what an mpd is, you don't need to worry about it to get your Pocket Chip functioning as a music server for your domain, so don't worry about it if you don't care to.  I also don't recommend using MPoD, or any MPD interface from your phone, since it will be a pain for guests in your apartment to have to download an app to be able to control the music.

For non-Spotify subscribers, like me (I use Google Music), here is a full tutorial.  Full disclosure: I'm copying some sections of [pynboer's](https://bbs.nextthing.co/users/pnyboer/activity) comment so you don't have to jump between parts of his tutorial and mine.

<br>

### Install and Configure Mopidy

You'll need to add a repository to your apt-get sources, then install mopidy.  FYI, the default password for the Pocket CHIP is `chip`.

	wget -q -O - https://apt.mopidy.com/mopidy.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
	sudo wget -q -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mopidy.list https://apt.mopidy.com/jessie.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install mopidy

Now launch mopidy for the sole purpose of installing some default configuration files:

	mopidy

and `ctl-c` to quit it once it has finished booting.

At the time of writing, Mopidy is version 2.0.1. Check your version with:

	mopidy --version
If it's not the newest version, you should fix the local scan script:

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y wget
	cp  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mopidy/audio/scan.py scan.py.bak
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeeSpotRun/mopidy/fix/gstreamer_not_pushing_tags_2/mopidy/audio/scan.py
	sudo cp scan.py /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mopidy/audio/scan.py


You will need to install python development tools so you can use [pip] to install some extensions:

	sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
	sudo easy_install pip

<br>

### Install a back end extension for your music service

Here are the backend extensions that work with Mopidy: [https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/backends/](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/backends/).  If you are a Google Music subscriber, you are in luck.  The GMusic extension is actually much better than the Spotify one, since it adds your saved library to Mopidy, in addition to allowing you to stream the entire contents of the service.  However, this tutorial will work for any of the backend music services that have been developed for mopidy. Make sure to follow the instructions on the backend service's github page.  For example, for GMusic, I had to `pip install mopidy-gmusic`

		
Now, modify the config file:

You can navigate to the config file using the CHIP's built in file browser, or you can type:

	nano ~/.config/mopidy/mopidy.conf

You will need to add the information needed for your backend service.  Each backend service's github ReadMe contains the information you will need.  

<br>

### Install a web interface

You will also be installing a web interface, so you will need to change the [http] section of the config file as well:

	[http]
	#enabled = true
	hostname = ::
	#port = 6680
	#static_dir =
	#zeroconf = Mopidy HTTP server on $hostname

The hostname is the only part you will need to change from the default.  Be sure to remove the `#` at the beginning of the line, since it is commenting out the line to use the default.  You can find more information here: [https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/http/](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/http/)

Now, to make sure the configs are loaded into Mopidy (and if you have any local music you want added), run:

	mopidy local scan

before you start mopidy on CHIP with:

	mopidy 

If mopidy runs without errors, then close it (with `ctrl-c`), and let's install a web interface.  Here are the available web extensions: [https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/web/#ext-web](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/ext/web/#ext-web).  I recommend installing [Mopidy-Mobile](https://github.com/tkem/mopidy-mobile) and  [Mopidy-Moped](https://github.com/martijnboland/moped).  You can test them out to see which one works better for you (and your guests).  I use Mopidy-Mobile on my phone and Mopidy-Moped on my laptop.

	sudo pip install Mopidy-Mobile
	sudo pip install Mopidy-Moped

### Try it out!

Now you can use a browser to get at  `http://chip.local:6680/1`
to access the web client. You may need to get the IP address from your Pocket CHIP if "chip.local" isn't working. You can do that in a terminal on the Pocket CHIP with the command `ip a` and find the address for `wlan0`.  I hope you enjoy and give all your roommates and visitors the URL.

### What if I just want to stream internet radio from my Pocket CHIP?

Try out this simple command line interface for internet radio: [https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio](https://github.com/coderholic/pyradio)

You might notice that the volume defaults to 100% every time you change a station...

Don't worry.  You can edit the underlying mplayer's config file (the underlying audio player for pyradio) so that it defaults to 50% (or whatever you choose) instead. `"echo 'volume=50' >> ~/.mplayer/config"`
